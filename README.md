<H2>This mini project its basically a research I'm doing on my own, I'm learning a bit of Data Science and its implementation with Stocks analysis. </H2> 

<p> I'm using Pandas and YFinance to manipulate the data, and also matplotlib to portray the info</p>
<p>For instance, dont use it for anything that might risk your capital, do not take any financial advises(I do not take any responsabilities). I'm just a Python guy learning some new stuff</p>
